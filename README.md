# Google-Admin-Console-API

This script can be used to retrieve,modify,and delete data from the Google Admin Console database. Currently, the script only retrieves chromebook attributes such as mac address, asset tag, and recent users, but I will be making modifications and adding features that will make it easier to change queries.
